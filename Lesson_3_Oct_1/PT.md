This is your first progress task. Please download the task file from the attachment, do the task, and submit here. You have 15 minutes for everything (include uploading)! 

Make sure you test your code with `runghc <filename>` and the test cases `main = ...`, like what we did during the previous lesson. You will not get point if your code cannot be compiled (i.e. syntax error), or if the test cases are not fulfilled (i.e. wrong code logic). 



-- main = print (invertAndCube 2)    -- "-8"
-- main = print (invertAndCube (-10))  -- "100"
-- main = print (invertAndCube 3)    -- "-27"
-- main = print (invertAndCube 0)    -- "0"
-- main = print (invertAndCube (-5))   -- "25"
